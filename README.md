## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- using an "active" css class to toggle changes on click gives a much simpler javascript code than adding styles in the javascript click function
- in order to resize svg elements, don't try to change the width and height properties as this will mess with the aspect ratio

### Continued development

I'd like to continue learning about creating smoother animations on click events
